# Care home Web Project

Care homes require websites to provide essential information, build trust, and facilitate communication with families and residents. They also often need features for inquiries, staff management, and compliance with UK healthcare regulations.

Features:

- Informational pages (Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQs).
- Simple inquiry form for admissions or appointments.
- Gallery or video tours of facilities.
- Responsive design optimised for accessibility.
- GDPR-compliant data handling for contact forms.
